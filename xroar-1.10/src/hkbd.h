// hk_init() will call OS-specific initialisation - hk_init_*() - which will
// try to do two things:
//
// 1. Identify how OS-native scancodes relate to real keyboards, and build a
// table - hkbd.os_scancode_to_hk_scancode - mapping those codes to USB HID
// style position based scancodes (hk_scan_*).
//
// - Under X11, a keyboard "fingerprint" is taken (technique borrowed from
// SDL), and the table maps X11 keycodes, supporting quite a few common
// mappings.
//
// - Under Windows, the table is fixed (bar user configuration) and is indexed
// by virtual scancode (VSC).  XXX not done yes as not required for SDL.
//
// - Under Mac OS X+, the table is similarly fixed, and is indexed by virtual
// keycode.  XXX not done yes as not required for SDL.
//
// - This table is intended to help UI modules use the scancode-based host
// keyboard interface.
//
// 2. Query which symbol is on each key at each relevant shift level, builidng
// another table - hkbd.code_to_sym - mapping hk_scan_* + level to symbol
// (hk_sym_*).
